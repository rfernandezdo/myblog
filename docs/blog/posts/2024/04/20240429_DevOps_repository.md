# Repository Strategy: Monorepo vs Multi-repo

In this post, I will explain the repository strategy that I will use for my Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project with Terraform. 

## Monorepo

A monorepo is a single repository that contains all the code for a project. 

The benefits of using a monorepo include:

- **Simplicity**: All the code is in one place, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Consistency**: Developers can easily see all the code related to a project and ensure that it follows the same standards and conventions.
- **Reusability**: Code can be shared across different parts of the project, reducing duplication and improving consistency.
- **Versioning**: All the code is versioned together, making it easier to track changes and roll back if necessary.

The challenges of using a monorepo include:

- **Complexity**: A monorepo can become large and complex, making it harder to navigate and understand.
- **Build times**: Building and testing a monorepo can take longer than building and testing smaller repositories.
- **Conflicts**: Multiple developers working on the same codebase can lead to conflicts and merge issues.

## Multi-repo

A multi-repo is a set of separate repositories that contain the code for different parts of a project.

The benefits of using a multi-repo include:

- **Isolation**: Each repository is independent, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Flexibility**: Developers can work on different parts of the project without affecting each other.
- **Scalability**: As the project grows, new repositories can be added to manage the code more effectively.

The challenges of using a multi-repo include:

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple repositories can be more challenging than managing a single repository.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring that all the repositories follow the same standards and conventions can be difficult.
- **Versioning**: Each repository is versioned separately, making it harder to track changes across the project.

## Conclusion

For my IaC project with Terraform, I will use a monorepo approach to manage all the Terraform modules and configurations for my project.
