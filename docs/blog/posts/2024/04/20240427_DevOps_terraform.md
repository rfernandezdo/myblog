# Starting my IaC project with terraform

This is not my first IaC project but I want to share with you some key considerations that I have in mind to start a personal IaC project with Terraform based on post [What you need to think about when starting an IaC project ?]

[What you need to think about when starting an IaC project ?]:(20240526_DevOps.md)


## 1. **Define Your Goals**

These are my goals:

- Automate the provisioning of infrastructure
- Improve consistency and repeatability
- Reduce manual effort
- Enable faster deployments


## 2. **Select the Right Tools**

For my project I will use Terraform because I am familiar with it and I like its declarative configuration language.

## 3. **Design Your Infrastructure**


In my project, I will use a modular design that separates my infrastructure into different modules, such as networking, compute, and storage. This will allow me to reuse code across different projects and make my infrastructure more maintainable.

## 4. **Version Control Your Code**

I will use Git for version control and follow best practices for version control, such as using descriptive commit messages and branching strategies.

## 5. **Automate Testing**

Like appear in [Implement compliance testing with Terraform and Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/best-practices-compliance-testing), I'd  like to implement: 

- Compliance testing
- End-to-end testing
- Integration testing

## 6. **Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

I set up my  CI/CD pipelines with Github Actions.


## 7. **Monitor and Maintain Your Infrastructure**

I will use Azure Monitor to monitor my infrastructure and set up alerts to notify me of any issues. I will also regularly review and update my infrastructure code to ensure that it remains up to date and secure.


Of course I don't have all the answers yet, but I will keep you updated on my progress and share my learnings along the way. Stay tuned for more updates on my IaC project with Terraform!
