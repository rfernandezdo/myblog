# Repository Strategy: Fork vs Branch

In this post, I will explain the different ways to contribute to a Git repository: Fork vs Branch.

## Fork

A fork is a copy of a repository that you can make changes to without affecting the original repository. When you fork a repository, you create a new repository in your GitHub account that is a copy of the original repository.

The benefits of forking a repository include:

- **Isolation**: You can work on your changes without affecting the original repository.
- **Collaboration**: You can make changes to the forked repository and submit a pull request to the original repository to merge your changes.  
- **Ownership**: You have full control over the forked repository and can manage it as you see fit.

The challenges of forking a repository include:

- **Synchronization**: Keeping the forked repository up to date with the original repository can be challenging.
- **Conflicts**: Multiple contributors working on the same codebase can lead to conflicts and merge issues.
- **Visibility**: Changes made to the forked repository are not visible in the original repository until they are merged.


## Branch

A branch is a parallel version of a repository that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main codebase. When you create a branch, you can make changes to the code and submit a pull request to merge the changes back into the main branch.

The benefits of using branches include:

- **Flexibility**: You can work on different features or bug fixes in separate branches without affecting each other.
- **Collaboration**: You can work with other developers on the same codebase by creating branches and submitting pull requests.
- **Visibility**: Changes made in branches are visible to other developers, making it easier to review and merge changes.

The challenges of using branches include:

- **Conflicts**: Multiple developers working on the same branch can lead to conflicts and merge issues.
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple branches can be challenging, especially in large projects.
- **Versioning**: Branches are versioned separately, making it harder to track changes across the project.

## Fork vs Branch

The decision to fork or branch a repository depends on the project's requirements and the collaboration model.

- **Fork**: Use a fork when you want to work on changes independently of the original repository or when you want to contribute to a project that you do not have write access to.

- **Branch**: Use a branch when you want to work on changes that will be merged back into the main codebase or when you want to collaborate with other developers on the same codebase.



For my IaC project with Terraform, I will use branches to work on different features and bug fixes and submit pull requests to merge the changes back into the main branch. This approach will allow me to collaborate with other developers and keep the codebase clean and organized.
