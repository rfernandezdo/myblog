# Comparing Container Apps with other Azure container options

## Container option comparisons

| Service | Primary Use | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Azure Container Apps        | Building serverless microservices and jobs based on containers | Optimized for general purpose containers. Provides a fully managed experience based on best-practices. | Doesn't provide direct access to Kubernetes APIs. |
| Azure App Service           | Fully managed hosting for web applications including websites and web APIs | Integrated with other Azure services. Ideal option for building web apps.  | Might not be suitable for non-web applications. |
| Azure Container Instances   | Provides a single isolated container on demand  |  It's a great solution for any scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.  | Concepts like scale, load balancing, and certificates are not provided.  |
| Azure Kubernetes Service    | Provides a fully managed Kubernetes option in Azure | Supports any Kubernetes workload. Complete control over cluster configurations and operations. | Requires management of the full cluster within your subscription. |
| Azure Functions             | Serverless Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) solution | Optimized for running event-driven applications using the functions programming model.  | Limited to ephemeral functions deployed as either code or containers.  |
| Azure Spring Apps           | Fully managed service for Spring developers  | Service manages the infrastructure of Spring applications allowing developers to focus on their code. | Only suitable for running Spring-based applications. |
| Azure Red Hat OpenShift     | Jointly engineered, operated, and supported by Red Hat and Microsoft to provide an integrated product and support experience  | Offers built-in solutions for automated source code management, container and application builds, deployments, scaling, health management. | Dependent on OpenShift. If your team or organization is not using OpenShift, this may not be the ideal option. |

Please note that the advantages and disadvantages may vary according to specific use cases.
