# Starting to develop in c\#

First, I need to clarify that I'm not a C# developer. I'm learning C# so I can better understand the code that has to be deployed to some Azure services when .NET is used.

If someone that knows me is reading this post, he/she will be thinking: 

- "What the hell is he doing?"
- "He is crazy"
- "He is going to die trying".
- The end of the world is approaching!!


Maybe the last thought can be really true but I have to say that I have decided to learn a programming language and that I have chosen C# because many of the examples for Azure Developers that I have seen are written in C#.

I repeat, I am not a developer but I'd like to share with you my experience learning C#.


## My first Steps

You have a lot of resources for learning on [Learn .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and in [c# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

In my case I prefer to simplify and follow [csharp-notebooks](https://github.com/dotnet/csharp-notebooks), these materials are designed to be used with [
C# 101 SERIES](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/csharp-101/).

After that, I will follow the free course [(New) Foundational C# with Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/).

And after that, I think that I will be ready to start with [Tutorials for getting started with .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/get-started?source=recommendations) and plan next steps.


That's all folks!!
