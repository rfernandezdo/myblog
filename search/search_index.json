Durante ese tiempo, Rafael fue no solo mi jefe directo, sino tambi\u00e9n mi mentor dentro de la empresa. No puedo decir ni una cosa mala sobre \u00e9l; es un excelente l\u00edder, uno de los pocos que he encontrado en mi vida laboral, que nunca te pide algo que \u00e9l mismo no pueda hacer.</p> <p>Rafael siempre est\u00e1 dispuesto a echar una mano si ve que est\u00e1s desbordado o perdido. Como mentor, aplica siempre el principio de \u201cno le des un pez, ens\u00e9\u00f1ale a pescar\u201d. Me ayud\u00f3 a reconducir todas las situaciones en las que me encontr\u00e9 con un callej\u00f3n sin salida, apuntando en la direcci\u00f3n en la que ten\u00eda que seguir avanzando.</p> <p>A nivel t\u00e9cnico, Rafael es excepcional. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su conocimiento, sorprende por su capacidad para aprender en un tiempo m\u00ednimo lo necesario para resolver cualquier tipo de problema. Trabajar con \u00e9l es tremendamente f\u00e1cil, ya que nunca tiene una mala palabra ni un mal gesto y genera un ambiente de trabajo incre\u00edblemente positivo.</p> <p>Rafael demuestra un profundo conocimiento no solo t\u00e9cnico en las \u00e1reas que le competen, sino tambi\u00e9n de planificaci\u00f3n, an\u00e1lisis y gesti\u00f3n. He tenido la gran suerte de trabajar con \u00e9l y sin duda es una de las personas que me gustar\u00eda que formara parte de cualquier equipo en el que me encuentre ahora o en el futuro.</p> <p>Rafael es un maestro en las artes inform\u00e1ticas y un verdadero profesional. En su trabajo no deja nada al azar, todo lo estudia detenidamente y suele tomar muy buenas decisiones. Adem\u00e1s, Rafael es un profesional altamente calificado. Tiene una actitud amigable y resuelve r\u00e1pidamente cualquier pregunta que tengas, explic\u00e1ndote siempre la soluci\u00f3n. Si tienes alg\u00fan problema, \u00e9l es la persona adecuada a quien pedir ayuda.</p> <p>Espero que este testimonio brinde una visi\u00f3n clara del incre\u00edble profesional y persona que es Rafael. Estoy seguro de que aquellos que tengan la oportunidad de trabajar con \u00e9l se beneficiar\u00e1n enormemente de su liderazgo, conocimientos t\u00e9cnicos y actitud positiva.</p>"},{"location":"#who-am-i","title":"Who am I?","text":"<p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>I'm Rafa, and this is my little corner on the web.</p> <p>As a passionate IT professional, I love exploring new technologies, facing new challenges, and sharing my experiences with others.</p> <p>Since I'm pretty bad at introducing myself, I've asked chatgpt to help me do it based on comments from some of my coworkers on Linkedin, this is the result:</p>"},{"location":"#an-exceptional-leader-and-mentor","title":"An Exceptional Leader and Mentor","text":"<p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>Today I want to share with you my experience working with an incredibly talented professional, Rafael.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to work with him at Bravent for over six months. During that time, Rafael was not only my direct boss, but also my mentor within the company. I can't say a single bad thing about him; He is an excellent leader, one of the few I have encountered in my working life, who never asks you for something that he cannot do himself.</p> <p>Rafael is always willing to lend a hand if he sees that you are overwhelmed or lost. As a mentor, he always applies the principle of \u201cdon't give him a fish, teach him to fish.\u201d He helped me redirect all the situations in which I found myself at a dead end, pointing in the direction in which I had to continue moving forward.</p> <p>On a technical level, Rafael is exceptional. Beyond his knowledge, he is surprised by his ability to learn in a minimum amount of time what is necessary to solve any type of problem. Working with him is tremendously easy, since he never has a bad word or a bad gesture and generates an incredibly positive work environment.</p> <p>Rafael demonstrates deep knowledge not only of technical knowledge in the areas in which he is responsible, but also of planning, analysis and management. I have had the great fortune to work with him and he is undoubtedly one of the people I would like to be part of any team I am on now or in the future.</p> <p>Rafael is a master of computer arts and a true professional. In his work he leaves nothing to chance, he studies everything carefully and he usually makes very good decisions. Furthermore, Rafael is a highly qualified professional. He has a friendly attitude and quickly resolves any questions you have, always explaining the solution. If you have a problem, he is the right person to ask for help.</p> <p>I hope this testimony provides a clear vision of the incredible professional and person that Rafael is. I am confident that those who have the opportunity to work with him will benefit greatly from his leadership, technical knowledge and positive attitude.</p>"},{"location":"contributions/","title":"Contributions","text":"<p>Better or worse, here I am adding my contributions in case one day I have to compile them to be MVP (a real pain):</p> <p>Generally, I try to contribute to the community in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>Post/shares in Linkedin</li> <li>Post in my blog</li> <li>Some contributions to github projects azure related(see below)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"contributions/#2023","title":"2023","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Microsoft Azure Documentation</p> <ul> <li>Added comparative table to Containers</li> <li>Add mind maps to WAF pillars</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>mingrammer</p> <ul> <li>Update azure icons to v12 mingrammer</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Terraform module</p> <ul> <li>First version of the module to support azurerm_linux_function_app</li> <li>Feature/add ddos protection plan id var non global to ddos</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"contributions/#2022","title":"2022","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Terraform module</p> <ul> <li>Adding support for Digital Twins</li> <li>Submodule Eventgrid</li> <li>System Identity option added to identity in function app</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Global Azure Zaragoza 2022</p> <ul> <li>Enterprise Scale Zone \u2013 Empieza bien</li> <li>Enterprise Scale Zone \u2013 CAF Landing zones for Terraform</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Microsoft Azure Documentation</p> <ul> <li>Example added for Azure IP reserves in subnet</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Azure-Samples</p> <ul> <li>Update example KeyVault-Rotation-StorageAccountKey-PowerShell</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/tags/","title":"Posts by Tags","text":"<p>Following is a list of relevant tags:</p>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#azure-communication-services","title":"Azure Communication Services","text":"<ul> <li>Azure Communication Services</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#azure-well-architected-framework","title":"Azure Well-Architected Framework","text":"<ul> <li>Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF) mind maps</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#english","title":"English","text":"<ul> <li>Azure  Services</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#general","title":"General","text":"<ul> <li>Azure  Services</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#trunk","title":"Trunk","text":"<ul> <li>Trunk</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#csharp","title":"csharp","text":"<ul> <li>Starting to develop in c#</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#mkdocs","title":"mkdocs","text":"<ul> <li>Create a blog with MkDocs,mkdocs-material, mkdocs-rss-plugin and GitHub Pages</li> <li>Enhance your mkdocks.yml</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#vscode","title":"vscode","text":"<ul> <li>Trunk</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2023/10/17/hello-world-from-mkdocs-material/","title":"\"Hello world!!!\" from mkdocs-material","text":"<p>...</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/10/18/create-a-blog-with-mkdocsmkdocs-material-mkdocs-rss-plugin-and-github-pages/","title":"Create a blog with MkDocs,mkdocs-material, mkdocs-rss-plugin and GitHub Pages","text":"<p>A few time ago I maintained a blog with Wordpress.
