I was happy with it, but I wanted to try something new. </p> <p>I tried Jekyll but it didn't convince me, I discovered mkdocs so I decided to use MkDocs and mkdocs-material. I was happy with the result, so I decided to write this post to explain how to create a blog with MkDocs, mkdocs-material and some plugins.</p> <p>These is the first post of a serie of posts to create a blog with MkDocs, mkdocs-material and GitHub Pages and some customization.</p> <p>Some knowledge:</p> <ul> <li> <p>MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Material for MkDocs is a theme for MkDocs, a static site generator geared towards (technical) project documentation. It is built using Google's Material Design guidelines. Material for MkDocs provides a polished and responsive experience out of the box, and it is as easy to use for the beginner as it is for the seasoned developer.</p> </li> <li> <p>GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see more information about GitHub Pages here.</p> </li> <li> <p>This plugin generates an RSS feed for your MkDocs site. You can see more information about mkdocs-rss-plugin here.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["DevOps"]},{"location":"blog/2023/10/18/create-a-blog-with-mkdocsmkdocs-material-mkdocs-rss-plugin-and-github-pages/#steps-to-deploy","title":"Steps to deploy","text":"<ol> <li>Create a new repository</li> </ol> <p>Create a new repository on GitHub named <code>username.github.io</code>, where <code>username</code> is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
